#### Q1
Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

#### Q2
Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

#### Q4
Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead of waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`, one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

#### Q5
Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`. What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

```

#### Q6
One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it does not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? Run `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`. Are system resources being effectively utilized?

#### Q7
Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

#### Q8
Now run with some randomly generated processes: \
`-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or \
`-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or \
`-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`.\
See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` vs. `-I_IO RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` vs. `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

#### Q8 Response
`-S SWITCH_ON_IO` vs `-S SWITCH_ON_END`\
I would expect shorter traces generally speaking on all random seeds when `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` because the system has available CPU resources to proceed with additional processes until IO is complete. Conversely, with `-S SWITCH_ON_END`, the CPU will not utilize available resources until IO is complete which is essentially wasting time--by extension these traces should take longer.\
