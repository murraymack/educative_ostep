### Exercises

#### Q1
Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

```shell
$ ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p

```

#### Q2
Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

#### Q4
Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead of waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`, one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

#### Q5
Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`. What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.
